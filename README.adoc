= Tad Docs

Welcome to the Tad Docs repository. Here, we welcome new Linux users with open
arms. Each document has a single goal: Teach users about everyday commands
used in a GNU/Linux ecosystem.

== Building

These documents are written in the AsciiDoc format. They can be read in their
initial plain text form, or built into a series of formats like HTML5 or PDF.
To complete this task, I suggest using the Asciidoctor program. Asciidoctor is
a Rubygem, and can be installed using the gem command. Once you have Ruby
installed, Asciidoctor can be installed using the following command:

```
$ gem install asciidoctor
$ gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre
```

Or, if you are into the bundler thing, you can do this as well:

```
$ bundle install
```

Then, you can use the ``build_documents.sh`` script to generate the documents.
Just pass it an argument for whatever filetype you wish to use.

```
$ bash build_documents.sh html
```
